## Ludum Dare 25 :: You are the enemy?!

A small bomberman-esque game where the goal is to stop the yourself from getting detained by the towns people and to blow up their houses for sick amounts of stacks. 

Move using the WASD keys

Drop a bomb with the J key

UPDATE: 
	In an effort to have something that i can call a game I am sort of short cutting the theme: There are purple people that will spawn randomly around the map. All they want to do is exist... you need to blow them up.

### What I would have liked to do:
	My original plan was to have several guys run away from you while trying to build houses. You would blow up the houses or people. The goal would be to not let the little towns people build their houses and upgrade them to police stations so that they could fight back and get you.

	I spent far too much time trying to think of the "best way" to do something so i wrote and rewrote and white boarded again and again... when really I could have just brute forced the game with plenty of time to spare.
