## Ludum Dare 25 :: You are the enemy?!

A small bomberman-esque game where the goal is to stop the yourself from getting detained by the towns people and to blow up their houses for sick amounts of stacks. 

Move using the WASD keys

Drop a bomb with the J key

UPDATE: 
	In an effort to have something that i can call a game I am sort of short cutting the theme: There are purple people that will spawn randomly around the map. All they want to do is exist... you need to blow them up.
